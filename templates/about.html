<a href={% url 'home' %}>Back to Word Count</a>
<br />

<p>This word count tool, powered by Django, was
  built and created to allow users to enter any amount of text and
  return the number of words in that text.</p>

<p>Though I don't take full credit for this project, it's
  definitely a step forward in my ability to build/tinker with small websites
  using the Django framework.
